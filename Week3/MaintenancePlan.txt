Maintenance Plan for J-AND-B CIS399 CentOS 6.4 Server
===============================================================================
The core structure of the maintenance plan resides around a monthly schedule.

 1. Operating System Patches: On first Tuesday of each month, CentOS 6.4
 	security, system, and application patches will be analyzed. If the patches
 	are considered good for production use, the patches will be installed
 	during the maintenance window on the second Tuesday of the month.
 
 2. Emergency Patches: The System Administration team is required to be
 	subscribed to the CentOS 6.4 Announcement mailing list. This mailing list
 	will inform the administrators of potential security holes and other
 	concerns. To subscribe to the mailing list, browse to:

 		http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-announce

 	Each announced patch will be considered based on scope and impact. If the
 	patch is required for production, it may be installed outside of the
 	normal patch schedule. However, the patch may only be installed during a
 	maintenance window.

 3. Maintenance Windows: On each Tuesday and Thursday night, from 1900 hours
 	to midnight Pacific Time, a maintenance window may be claimed for work.
 	The only regularly scheduled window is during the second Tuesday of each
 	month and is designated for system patch installation. All other windows
 	are available to be claimed.

 4. Patch Installation: A System Administrator may utilize the 'yum' package
 	update utility to install system updates and patches.

 	To see a list of updates available for the system, run the following:

 		yum check-updates

 	To fully update the system, run the follow with root privilege:

 		yum update

 	To update only specific packages at a time, run the following with root
 	privilege:

 		yum update <package name(s)>
